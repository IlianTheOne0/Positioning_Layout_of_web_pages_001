				What is the History of Halloween?
			</h2>

			<p>
				Halloween’s origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced sow-in). The Celts,
				who lived 2,000 years ago, mostly in the area that is now Ireland, the United Kingdom and northern
				France, celebrated their new year on November 1.
			</p>

			<p>
				This day marked the end of summer and the harvest and the beginning of the dark, cold winter, a time of
				year that was often associated with human death. Celts believed that on the night before the new year,
				the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead became blurred. On the night of October 31
				they celebrated Samhain, when it was believed that the ghosts of the dead returned to earth.

				Did you know that...
			</h2>

			<p>
				When it comes to spooky celebrations, two names often come to mind: Halloween and Helloween. While they
				might sound similar, these two occasions have distinct characteristics and histories. Halloween is a
				widely recognized holiday with a rich history, while Helloween is a more recent concept that has gained
				popularity in certain circles.

						<h3>Jack-o’-Lanterns</h3>

						<p>
							The tradition of carving Jack-o’-Lanterns originated in Ireland using turnips instead of
							pumpkins.
							It is allegedly based on a legend about a man named Stingy Jack who repeatedly trapped the
							Devil
							and
							only let him go on the condition that Jack would never go to Hell. But when Jack died, he
							learned
							that Heaven did not want his soul either, so he was forced to wander the Earth as a ghost
							for
							eternity. The Devil gave Jack a burning lump of coal in a carved-out turnip to light his
							way.
							Locals
							eventually began carving scary faces into their own turnips to frighten away evil spirits.

						<h3>Wearing Scary Costumes</h3>

						<p>
							In order to avoid being terrorized by all the evil spirits walking the Earth during Samhain,
							the
							Celts donned disguises in order to confuse the spirits and be left alone.

						<h3>Trick-or-Treating</h3>

						<p>
							Trick-or-treating may have origins in three traditions: Celtic Samhain, where people dressed
							as
							spirits for food; Scottish "guising," where children collected treats in exchange for songs
							or
							tricks; and German-American "belsnickeling," where disguised children received treats if
							neighbors couldn’t guess their identities.
